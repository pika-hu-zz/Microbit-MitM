# Microbit Man in the Middle Attack

## Introduction

The *Microbit Man in the Middle Attack* is a rudimentary arduino workshop designed to demonstrate one of many cyberattacks and how we could defend ourselves against it. Participants in the workshop will build a communication device to send messages over radio using microbit, have these messages intercepted by a foreign microbit, then encrypt their messages using a Caesar shift cipher.
