# Microbit Man in the Middle Attack

## Introduction

The *Microbit Man in the Middle Attack* is a rudimentary arduino workshop designed to demonstrate one of many cyberattacks and how we could defend ourselves against it. Participants in the workshop will build a communication device to send messages over radio using microbit, have these messages intercepted by a foreign microbit, then encrypt their messages using a Caesar shift cipher.

## Concepts Covered

* Programming logic
    * Methods/Functions
    * Inputs
    * Variables
    * For Loops
* Encryption
* Radio Technology
